# Turtlebot3 Robot-based target recognition and tracking

This is a robot-based target recognition and tracking experiment. Need to have ROS „ÄÅGazebo and Turtlebot3 robot simulation. 

* First you need to create a random environment and put it in the Turtlebot3 folder or you can revise the launch file for the empty world.
* And run the launch file for run the two robots.
* Run the visual process node.
* Run the control process in python file.

```bash
$ roslaunch opencv_examples turtlebot3_follow.launch 
$ rosrun opencv_examples find_contours 
$ rosrun turtlebot_teleop turtlebot3_1_teleop 
```
